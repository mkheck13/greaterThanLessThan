# Greater Than Less Than #4

**Description**: Create a console project that prompts the user to enter two numbers. The console then prints out two statements. The first statement will tell the user if the first number is greater than, less than or equal to the second number. The second statement will tell the user if the second number is greater than, less than, or equal to the first number. Add the ability to play agian as well.
